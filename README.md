## Project Intro
Our MVP is a Rust-based network monitoring tool. It is designed to help network administrators or developers monitor network traffic and diagnose network problems. The main goals and objectives of our project are:

    Monitor network traffic in real-time.
    Display information about network performance, including bandwidth usage, packet loss, and latency.
    Support multiple network interfaces for monitoring.
    Allow customization of monitoring parameters such as time intervals and network interface selection.
    Provide a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use.

We chose to work on this project because we believe that a reliable and efficient network monitoring tool can be useful in various industries and fields. We also wanted to challenge ourselves to learn more about network protocols and Rust programming language.
